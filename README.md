# Reviews-Slider

Repository name: Review-Slider

Description:
This GitHub repository contains a JavaScript project that implements a review slider. A review slider is a web component that allows you to display reviews or testimonials in a dynamic and interactive way. In this project, we use JavaScript to create a simple review slider with navigation buttons to switch between reviews.

Key Features:
1) Displays reviews from different people, including their names, job titles, and profile images.
2) Allows users to navigate through reviews using "Next," "Previous," and "Random" buttons.
3) Random button selects a review at random, adding an element of surprise.

Getting Started:
To use this review slider in your web project, follow these steps:

1) Clone the repository to your local machine
2) Once the repository is cloned, open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to see the review slider in action.
3) To understand how the review slider works and how each review is displayed, explore the JavaScript code in the script.js file within the cloned repository. You'll find detailed comments explaining each part of the code.
4) Feel free to integrate the review slider script into your own web projects to display reviews or testimonials in an interactive way. You can copy the relevant HTML structure and JavaScript functions into your project and modify them as needed.
